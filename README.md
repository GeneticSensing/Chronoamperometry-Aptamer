# Chronoamperometry-Aptamer

Contains necessary scripts to run square wave voltammetry (SWV) measurements with an Emstat 4 or Emstat Pico, as well as process PSTrace SWV exports to find peak magnitudes.

Supporting documentation for running SWV measurements on Emstat devices is found under [`swv_scripts`](swv_scripts/README.md).

Supporting documentation for processing PSTrace SWV exports to find peak magnitudes is found under [`swv_processing`](swv_processing/README.md).
